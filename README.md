# ElectPoll

### Problem Definition

Despite the potential benefits of electronic voting, the adoption of e-voting in Nigeria (and any other countries) has been slow due o a lack of infrastructure and a slow adaptation of technology. The traditional paper ballot system is prone to errors and fraud and causes long lines and delays on election day. The stress of the paper ballot system needs to be addressed with an efficient and secure solution.

ElectPoll aims to provide a secure, reliable, and user-friendly online platform for conducting polls and elections, overcoming the limitations of the paper-based system and promoting the broader adoption of e-voting in Nigeria (and any other countries), thus increasing the accuracy and transparency of the electoral process.
