    <h2>Problem Definition</h2>
  </summary>
  
  <p>
Despite the potential benefits of electronic voting, the adoption of e-voting in many countries (especially Nigeria) has been slow due to a lack of infrastructure and a slow adaptation of technology. The traditional paper ballot system is prone to errors and fraud and causes long lines and delays on election day. The stress of the paper ballot system needs to be addressed with an efficient and secure solution.

ElectPoll aims to provide a secure, reliable, and user-friendly online platform for conducting polls and elections, overcoming the limitations of the paper-based system and promoting the broader adoption of e-voting in these countries, thus increasing the accuracy and transparency of the electoral process.

    <h2>The target audience</h2>
  </summary>
  
  <p>
On a large scale, ElectPoll has the potential to serve a wide range of target audiences. One key audience is government officials and political parties, who require a more efficient and transparent voting system.

But for a start, the critical target audience is the student population, particularly in universities. With the growing need for student representation and participation in university decision-making, e-voting presents a valuable solution for student government elections and other campus-wide polls. Implementing ElectPoll in universities would increase voter turnout and engagement and provide a more accurate and fair representation of student opinions and preferences.

Additionally, ElectPoll can be helpful for organisations, trade unions, and other groups that need to conduct internal elections or polls. ElectPoll can provide a secure and efficient platform for these organisations to conduct their voting process.

All in all, ElectPoll has the potential to serve a wide range of target audiences, from government officials and political parties to students and organisations, all of whom require a secure and reliable voting system.

    <h2>Conducting Surveys/Interviews</h2>
  </summary>
  
  <p>
We conducted two rounds of surveys/interviews, one to hear thoughts and opinions on the topic of electronic voting, another to access or solution's impact during production. We used info from the first survey to draw up our empathy maps, jot down concerns and cultural factors that may affect our solution.

    <h2>Security Concerns</h2>
  </summary>
  
  <p>
In the setting up of Electpoll, several security concerns were brought up and considered to ensure that the system is reliable and secure. Some of these security concerns are:

    <h2>Cultural Factors</h2>
  </summary>
  
  <p>
Through brainstorming amongst ourselves and feedback from potential users, we came about a list of cultural factors that could affect a voting system being a reality and we tried our best to find a solution to the solvables in Electpoll.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Literacy & technological literacy
    <li>Trust in government & technology
    <li>Social & political culture inclusivity
    <li>Access to technology

    <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
  </summary>
  
  <p>
We had a lot of fun making the competitive analysis. We made a list of companies/organizations that did similar to what we plan to do, and ran them against some parameters. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UxzbUTeReYBQlPdLrLhbsPgxqCkoABDFvrRCNlmnf2U/edit?usp=sharing">Access the competitive analysis here.</a>

    <h2>Empathy Mapping</h2>
  </summary>
  
  <p>
Empathy mapping is an effective method for learning about and relating to the people we seek to help, and we decided to draw some up. Empathy mapping allowed us to put ourselves in the shoes of our potential users of our electronic voting solution, allowing us to better cater to their wants and needs.

Voters, election officials, and political parties involved in the electoral process had their views, needs, ambitions, and frustrations explored through our empathy maps. By doing so, we learned more about their perspectives, feelings, and actions, which helped us design a more equitable and efficient electronic voting system.

    <h2>Features List</h2>
  </summary>
  
  <p>
After working with the competitive analysis and empathy maps for ElectPoll, it was concluded that the e-voting system should possess various features that promote transparency, security, accessibility, and efficiency. These features will ensure that the electoral process is conducted fairly and free from any fraudulent activity. Below were the proposed features and their respective explanations:

<ul>
<li><b>Accessibility</b></li>
The e-voting system should be accessible to all eligible voters, regardless of their physical ability, location, or other barriers. It should be designed to be easily accessible and user-friendly for everyone.

<li><b>Voter Education</b></li>
The system should include a feature that provides adequate voter education to eligible voters before election day. This feature should provide information on voting procedures, voting rights, and any other relevant information that would enable voters to cast their votes without difficulty.

<li><b>Voter Identification</b></li>
The e-voting system should have a reliable and secure method of identifying registered voters. This feature ensures that only eligible voters cast their votes and prevents multiple voting. This could be in form of a unique voter ID/key.

<li><b>Consultation Support</b></li>
There should be a support system for users (electoral officers) who need assistance during the voting process. The support system can be in the form of a help desk, hotline, or chatbot to assist voters who may encounter difficulties during the voting process.

<li><b>Uploading of Voterâ€™s List</b></li>
This feature allows the election officials to upload the list of eligible voters into the e-voting system for easy identification during the voting process. The system should support various formats, including excel and other unique formats.

<li><b>Free for Less than 50 Voters</b></li>
The e-voting system should be free for organizations with less than 50 eligible voters. This feature is to encourage smaller organizations to participate in the electoral process without financial constraints.

<li><b>Quick Polls</b></li>
The system should have a feature that enables quick polls for emergency or time-sensitive situations. This feature allows for prompt decision-making and reduces the time required for the electoral process.

<li><b>Organization/Team Accounts</b></li>
This feature allows organizations or teams to create accounts on the e-voting system. The accounts would be used to manage the voting process, add eligible voters, and generate reports.

<li><b>Multi-Factor Authentication</b></li>
The e-voting system should have a multi-factor authentication system that requires voters to provide forms of identification before casting their votes. This feature adds an extra layer of security to prevent unauthorized access.

<li><b>Email Notice</b></li>
Email notice permits the electoral system to notify registered voters of impending elections, voting precincts (when applicable), and hours. This functionality can also notify voters of voter information changes or election process modifications. This feature can boost voter turnout by sending timely and appropriate emails to voters. Email notice can also clarify election information for voters.

<li><b>Customised candidates photos and bios</b></li>
This feature lets voters see candidate images and bios, making it easier to choose. This feature increases voter trust and transparency by providing candidates' histories, experience, and qualifications. Seeing candidate images helps people connect with candidates on a personal level. This enhances electoral integrity and legitimacy.

<li><b>Audit Trails</b></li>
This feature ensures that the voting process is transparent and secure by generating a log of all activities within the e-voting system. It provides a trail of all actions taken during the voting process, ensuring that the results are accurate and free from manipulation.
</ul>
