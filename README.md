    <h2>Problem Definition<h2/>
  </summary>
  
  <p>
Despite the potential benefits of electronic voting, the adoption of e-voting in many countries (especially Nigeria) has been slow due to a lack of infrastructure and a slow adaptation of technology. The traditional paper ballot system is prone to errors and fraud and causes long lines and delays on election day. The stress of the paper ballot system needs to be addressed with an efficient and secure solution.

ElectPoll aims to provide a secure, reliable, and user-friendly online platform for conducting polls and elections, overcoming the limitations of the paper-based system and promoting the broader adoption of e-voting in these countries, thus increasing the accuracy and transparency of the electoral process.

    <h2>The target audience<h2/>
  </summary>
  
  <p>
On a large scale, ElectPoll has the potential to serve a wide range of target audiences. One key audience is government officials and political parties, who require a more efficient and transparent voting system.

But for a start, the critical target audience is the student population, particularly in universities. With the growing need for student representation and participation in university decision-making, e-voting presents a valuable solution for student government elections and other campus-wide polls. Implementing ElectPoll in universities would increase voter turnout and engagement and provide a more accurate and fair representation of student opinions and preferences.

Additionally, ElectPoll can be helpful for organisations, trade unions, and other groups that need to conduct internal elections or polls. ElectPoll can provide a secure and efficient platform for these organisations to conduct their voting process.

All in all, ElectPoll has the potential to serve a wide range of target audiences, from government officials and political parties to students and organisations, all of whom require a secure and reliable voting system.

    <h2>Conducting Surveys/Interviews<h2/>
  </summary>
  
  <p>
We conducted two rounds of surveys/interviews, one to hear thoughts and opinions on the topic of electronic voting, another to access or solution's impact during production. We used info from the first survey to draw up our empathy maps, jot down concerns and cultural factors that may affect our solution.
